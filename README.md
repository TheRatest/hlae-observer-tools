# **HLAE Observer Tools**

HLAE Observer Tools is a (remote) observing control system for Counter-Strike 2 observing. It enables an observer desk to control and monitor an HLAE-injected game instance with low latency. This project is unaffiliated with @advancedfx and HLAE, but uses a modified fork to function.
